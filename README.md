## Whats in there?

See [Documentation](https://astina.github.io/yy) for details on how to use the stuff. Or have a look at the examples in `examples` directory.

### breakpoint
A system to define your breakpoints and use them in your sass with the mixin `respond-to`.
This system is used throughout yy.

### font
A system to define your fonts and their styles accross different breakpoints.

### sprite
A mixin to help you with resolution dependent spriting. Serve these hidpi sprites to devices with a high pixel density.
This is currently depending on compass, but there will be a mixin with the same interface using other spriting libraries at some time in the future.

### remPxFallback
A mixin that helps you with providing px fallbacks to browsers that [don't understand rem](http://caniuse.com/#search=rem).

###Â hacks
just a clearfix hack for now.
