/**
 * This gets the media query by using `getMediaQuery` for the given named breakpoint
 * and wraps everything that is within this mixin in `@media`
 *
 * To work, the mixin requires configuration in the form of a Sass map where keys are names for 
 * breakpoints/screen sizes you should provide yourself (this is the `$breakpoint` parameter you 
 * pass when calling the mixin) and values are maps of settings for the respectable breakpoint.
 *
 * If you provide a `mq` key in the map for the breakpoint, this is used as the media query.
 * Otherwise the media query is build out of `media`, `max-width`, `min-width`, `max-height`, `min-height` and `orientation`
 * If you need other media features in your media query, provide it in the `mq` value.
 *
 * @param {String}    $breakpoint - the name of breakpoint from global `$breakpoints` map
 *
 * @example scss
 * $breakpoints: (
 *    small:     (
 *        mq: "(min-width:  400px) and (max-width:  767px)",
 *    ),
 *    small-up:  (
 *        min-width: 400px
 *    ),
 *    medium:    (
 *        media: screen,
 *        min-width: 768px,
 *        max-width: 991px,
 *    ),
 *    medium-up: (
 *        media: screen,
 *        min-width: 768px,
 *    ),
 *    large:     (
 *        mq: "(min-width:  992px) and (max-width: 1299px)",
 *    ),
 *    large-up:  (
 *        mq: "(min-width:  992px)",
 *    ),
